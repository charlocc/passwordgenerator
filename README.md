## How it works


```
To start the process of generating a random password, click the red "generate password" button! 
You will then be presented with a series of prompts for password criteria.
You can input how many characters you would like the password to be 
(it has to be at least 8 characters, and no more than 128)
You can then input if youd like the password to include: 
* uppercase letters, 
* lowercase letters, 
* numbers, 
* and/or special characters 
(you must select at least one of these specifications).
Once you have answered all of the prompts, a password will be generated that matches the criteria you input!
